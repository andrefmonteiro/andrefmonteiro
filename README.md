Currently learning Java.
Beginner-level experience with Python and JavaScript.

Want to keep learning more about abstraction layers and system design. These were the concepts that got me into software in the first place, and understanding them is a pretty cool challenge.

Looking to collaborate on apps that solve real problems or create nice features on OSS.
