ðŸ‘‹ Hey all!

Iâ€™m AndrÃ© Monteiro, from Porto, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹


I'm learning web development â€“ I've used HTML and CSS and I'm currently writing my first JavaScript programs. I've also programmed in Python in the past, which made me appreciate software even more.


I also want to keep learning more about abstraction layers and system design. These were the concepts that got me into software in the first place, and understanding them is a pretty cool challenge.


Looking to collaborate on apps that solve real problems or create nice features on OSS.

ðŸ“« PM me if you want to bounce on any ideas!
